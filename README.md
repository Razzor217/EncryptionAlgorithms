# EncryptionAlgorithms
Implements various symmetrical encryption algorithms.  
Symmetric encryption uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. 
Therefore, a secret key must be exchanged beforehand between all parties; this project 
focuses on encryption and decryption without getting into key exchange protocols.  
Currently implemented procedures include:  
1. Shift Cipher (for the memes)
2. Vigen√®re Cipher
